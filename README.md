# Decaytrait_qtl

We are investigating the genetic architecture of decayed sexual traits in asexual females of the parasitoid wasp Asobara japonia. In particular, we conduct QTL analysis for the female functional virginity trait, which referes to asexual females resisting to mate or not fertilizing eggs after mating. In the case of A.japonica,asexual females completely reject mating from males. We found a single QTL with large phenotypic effects.
